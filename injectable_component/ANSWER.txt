1. What is the advantage of having initialization in configuration file? 
more simple, we just call what we needed in config.json

2. What is this pattern called? 
I think, it is dependency injection.

3. If you created a DBStore with path components/store/db_store what do you need to do to swap the implementation. 
Just need to change every variable/object with name store to DBStore, and changes the store directory to omponents/store/db_store.js.

4. Define steps to be done if you want to have the configuration file definable in environment variable like this: 
{
    "components": {
        "store": {
            "file": "{$WAREHOUSE_SERVICE_STORE_COMPONENT}",
            "dependencies": []
        },
        ...
    }
}

//bash
$ export WAREHOUSE_SERVICE_STORE_COMPONENT=components/store/db_store.js
$ node start.js
